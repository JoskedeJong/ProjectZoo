##Project Zoo

Goal: the goal for this project is to create several objects using JavaScript. 
These objects should have certain characteristics and functions that are inherited, and some that are unique.  
The goal and scope of this project is very much open to change.

####Objectives:
1. [ ] Create a prototype 'Animal'.
2. [ ] Create an instance of 'Animal'.
2. [ ] Create a function for 'Animal' that lets the instance declare what it is doing.
3. [ ] Create a prototype 'Monkey' that inherits traits from 'Animal'.
4. [ ] Create a instance of Monkey that demonstrably has properties from both 'Monkey' and  'Animal'.
