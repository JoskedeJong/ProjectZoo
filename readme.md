## Project Zoo

Goal: the goal for this project is to create several objects using JavaScript. 
These objects should have certain characteristics and functions that are inherited, and some that are unique.  
The goal and scope of this project is very much open to change.

#### Objectives:
* [x] Create a prototype 'Animal'.
* [x] Create an instance of 'Animal'.
* [x] Create a function for 'Animal' that lets the instance declare what it is doing.
* [x] Create a prototype 'Monkey' that inherits traits from 'Animal'.
* [x] Create an instance of Monkey that demonstrably has properties from both 'Monkey' and  'Animal'.
* [x] Add function that will:
* * [x] allows you to feed the monkey
* * [x] counts how much the mokey has been fed
* * [ ] responds if the monkey has been fed enough
* [x] add button that feeds the monkey
* [x] add function that returns the monkey's name
* [x] make the feed function report the name of the animal being fed 
* [ ] make feed counter track for each separate animal being fed
* [x] make Howler monkey shout on every third time being fed without changing the feed-function
* * Not satisfied with the shout-on-feed-function yet
